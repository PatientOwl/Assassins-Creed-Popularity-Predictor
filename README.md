# Assassins-Creed-Popularity-Predictor

In this machine learning project, our goal is to create a model that is able to predict the level of popularity (popular or unpopular) of new games in the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise based on specific features of the games and other related variables.

In this case, we predict the game's popularity based on whether it is considered a hit (>= 1 million sales) and how it correlates to critic scores.
